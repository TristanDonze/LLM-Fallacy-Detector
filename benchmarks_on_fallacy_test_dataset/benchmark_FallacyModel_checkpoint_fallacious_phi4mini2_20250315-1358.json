However, it's important to note that the company has invested heavily in research and development, which is why the cost is so high. Critics argue that it's overpriced, but they fail to consider the advanced features and the superior performance it offers. Moreover, the company's CEO has a Ph.D. in Computer Science, which means he knows what he's doing. So, it's not just about the price, but the value it provides. Critics who complain about the price are missing the point. They should be grateful for the innovation and the benefits it brings to the users.
