    "response": "**Your speech:**\n\n [BEG_OF_ANS]\n\n Gun control in the USA is a hotly debated topic, with many different opinions and viewpoints. One of the most common arguments in favor of gun control is that it would reduce the number of gun-related deaths. While this may be true, it is important to consider the other side of the argument as well. Gun control could lead to increased crime rates and an overall reduction in personal safety."
