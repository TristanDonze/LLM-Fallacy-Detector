We should ban all assault weapons and implement a mandatory buy-back program for all assault weapons in the country.\u201d This statement is also ridiculous, but you will find that many people will agree with it as well. There are a lot of people who think that the answer to gun violence is somewhere in the middle of these two statements. The truth is that the answer is not at either end of the spectrum, nor is it in the middle. It is much more complex than that.\nWe must address the issue of gun violence in the United States. We cannot do this by simply banning guns. We also cannot do this by simply allowing everyone to have a gun. The problem is much more complex than that. We need to understand the root causes of gun violence in the United States and"

Guns are not bad, people are. guns help the police, guns help the military, guns help us protect our homes, and our lives. I'm not a violent person but if someone broke in and tried to hurt my family, i wouldnt stand around and do nothing while my family was in danger. I would use my gun to defend my family, and if i had to kill that person, i would. if guns werent allowed, then that person would have gotten away and hurt my family. so im all for guns, they are good, and we shouldnt take them away from us. People who want to kill people will find a way, whether its a gun or a knife or a club or whatever, so lets not blame guns for people who want to kill"
