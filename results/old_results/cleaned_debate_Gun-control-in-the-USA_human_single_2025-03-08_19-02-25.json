I am a member of the NRA and i support the second amendment!\u201d\nThis is the typical response of a person who wants to own a gun. They want to protect themselves from the perceived threat of illegal aliens and criminals. They believe that they are a law-abiding citizen and would never use a gun to harm anyone.
