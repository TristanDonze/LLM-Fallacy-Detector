Banning guns would lead to an increase in illegal gun trafficking and leave law-abiding citizens defenseless.\n\nYour previous arguments: I understand that guns are a deeply ingrained part of American culture and history, but we must prioritize the safety and well-being of our citizens. Guns are responsible for a significant number of deaths each year"
